## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-09

### Added - The Great Shame Update üî•

#### Fun Friction System - Making Skipping Annoying üéÆüòà
- **NEW**: Progressive friction system that gets more annoying with each skip
- **Skip 1-2**: Normal button behavior (being nice... for now)
- **Skip 3-5**: **Moving Button** - runs away from cursor when you hover!
  - Button moves to random positions **8 times** before you can catch it (increased from 3)
  - **Much larger movement range**: 300px horizontal, 200px vertical (tripled!)
  - **Faster animations**: 0.2s transitions make it snappier and more evasive
  - **Multiple triggers**: Moves on hover, mouseover, AND click attempts
  - **Varied taunting messages**: "Nope! Try again!", "Missed me!", "Too slow!", "Can't catch me!"
  - Text changes to "Try to click me! üòà" and progresses through sarcastic messages
  - **Much more genuinely frustrating** - takes real effort to catch
- **Skip 6+**: **Math Puzzle** - solve simple addition to continue
  - Random math problems (e.g., "7 + 3 = ?")
  - Wrong answers show "Wrong! Try again, genius. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
  - Forces actual brain engagement instead of mindless clicking
- **IMPROVED**: Much more entertaining than boring click counters
